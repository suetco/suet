Suet is an analytics dashboard for Mailgun. It gives better insight into the performance of your transactional emails by providing answers to questions like: 

- Who received what email? Which ones were opened? What links were clicked? ([Screenshot](https://github.com/kehers/suet/raw/master/public_html/images/screenshots/feed.png))
- What’s user engagement like? ([Screenshot](https://github.com/kehers/suet/raw/master/public_html/images/screenshots/users.png))
- What device/platform are most used? ([Screenshot](https://github.com/kehers/suet/raw/master/public_html/images/screenshots/dashboard.png))
- Which email performed best? ([Screenshot](https://github.com/kehers/suet/raw/master/public_html/images/screenshots/email.png))
